# Pizza Bot

This project was about using JavaScript to create a pizzabot where the customer can place an order among different pizzas. Then the customer would get the price of the pizza and a cooking time of the pizza.

## The problem

In the earlier version of the pizzabot the user would get prompts and alerts when ordering the pizza. Later we replaced the prompts and alerts with HTML elements so that the user would get the feedback on the DOM. We used JavaScript functions and conditionals to approach to this problem.  If we had more time we would have done a drop down menu for the different pizza choices and we would have also styled more to give the page a better appearance.
