# Pizza Bot

This project was about using JavaScript to create a very simple pizzabot. It's one of the first websites I created during the Technigo Bootcamp in fall 2020, on my way to become a frontend developer. I did the project in pair programming together with another student, https://github.com/jespa374 .

## What it does

The user can place an order choosing among  three different pizzas and the number of pizzas he/she wants to order. As a result the user gets a summary about the total cost and the delivery time.
As this was one of the first projects we built with JS, there are some limitations to the functionality: The user can only order one type of pizza at a time and all the pizzas have the same price. 

## The problem

In the earlier version of the pizzabot the user would get prompts and alerts when ordering the pizza. Later we replaced the prompts and alerts with HTML elements so that the user would get the feedback on the DOM. We used JavaScript functions and conditionals to approach this problem. If we had had more time we would have done a nicer drop down menu for the different pizza choices and we would have also styled more to give the page a better appearance.
